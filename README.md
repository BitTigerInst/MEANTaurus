# MEANTaurus - Build an Amazon clone

Description
-----------

**MEANTaurus** aims to build an Amazon clone by via the technolog stack: MEAN + Stripe Payment. After this project, every team member should have a solid understanding of the MEAN framework and the E-commerce operations.

Plan
----

Based on our experiences on web development and descriptions metioned above, we require all member follow the Udemy course [Build and Amazon clone: Nodejs + MongoDB + Stripe Payment](https://www.udemy.com/build-an-amazon-clone-nodejs-stripe-elasticsearch/) and build up their own Amazon clones. Based on this prototype, we could further add more fancy features and improve the front-end design.

Language & Framework
--------------------

- JavaScript
- MEAN

Development Guildlines
----------------------

- __Modularity.__ Following the principle _"loose coupling and high cohesion"_, each module should be standalone.

- __Minimalism.__ Each module should be kept short, simple, and concise. Every piece of code should be transparent upon first reading. 
- __Easy extensibility.__ New modules (as new classes and functions) are should be simply add, and existing modules should be extended easily.
